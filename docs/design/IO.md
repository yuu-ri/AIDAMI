- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling with stateless services and message queues
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for tools and models
- **Cost-Aware**: Intelligent model selection and resource optimization

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Workflow Orchestration**: State machines with retry logic and checkpointing
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous message passing between services
- **Multi-Tier LLM Strategy**: Right-sized models for each task type
- **Sandbox Execution**: Isolated tool runtime for security
- **Vector-Based Learning**: Experience replay for continuous improvement

### MVP Component Specifications

#### 1. FastAPI Gateway (Simplified)
**Purpose**: HTTP interface for task submission and status checking

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /tasks` - Submit new task
- `GET /tasks/{task_id}` - Get task status
- `GET /tasks/{task_id}/logs` - Get execution logs

**Features**:
- Basic authentication (API keys)
- Request validation with Pydantic
- Async task handling with 202 responses
- Simple rate limiting (per-user)

#### 2. Temporal Workflow (Core Orchestrator)
**Purpose**: Manages the Plan → Execute → Review loop with retries

**Workflow Logic**:
```python
async def plan_execute_review_workflow(task_description: str):
    max_iterations = 3
    for attempt in range(max_iterations):
        # Plan
        plan = await workflow.execute_activity(
            generate_plan, task_description, 
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2)
        )
        
        # Execute
        results = await workflow.execute_activity(
            execute_plan, plan,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)
        )
        
        # Review
        review = await workflow.execute_activity(
            review_results, task_description, results,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=1)
        )
        
        if review.status == "APPROVED":
            return {"status": "success", "results": results}
        elif review.status == "FAILED":
            return {"status": "failed", "error": review.feedback}
        
        # REVISE: Add feedback to task description for next iteration
        task_description += f"\nRevision needed: {review.feedback}"
    
    return {"status": "max_iterations_reached"}
```

#### 3. LLM Router (Multi-Provider)
**Purpose**: Route requests to appropriate models with fallback

**Model Strategy**:
- **Planner**: Gemini 2.5 Pro (primary) → GPT-4o (fallback)
- **Reviewer**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (primary) → GPT-4o-mini (fallback)
- **AI Tools**: Mistral Small (primary) → GPT-4o-mini (fallback)

**Implementation**:
```python
class LLMRouter:
    async def call(self, model_type: str, prompt: str) -> str:
        providers = {
            "planner": ["gemini-2.5-pro", "gpt-4o"],
            "reviewer": ["gemini-2.5-flash", "gpt-4o-mini"],
            "ai_tool": ["mistral-small", "gpt-4o-mini"]
        }
        
        for provider in providers[model_type]:
            try:
                return await self._call_provider(provider, prompt)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"{provider} failed: {e}")
                continue
        raise Exception("All providers failed")
```

#### 4. Tool Registry (Essential Tools)
**Purpose**: Secure execution of predefined tools

**MVP Tools**:
- **Python Executor**: Sandboxed Python code execution
- **Web Search**: Search engine queries
- **File Operations**: Read/write local files
- **HTTP Client**: API calls to external services
- **Math Calculator**: Mathematical computations

**Security**: Each tool runs in isolated Docker containers with resource limits

#### 5. Data Layer (PostgreSQL + Redis)
**Purpose**: State persistence and caching

**PostgreSQL Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    task_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    result JSONB,
    error TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE executions (
    execution_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(task_id),
    plan JSONB NOT NULL,
    results JSONB,
    iteration INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Redis Usage**:
- LLM response caching (TTL: 1 hour)
- Rate limiting counters
- Active workflow state

| **Component**                                  | **Recommended Provider**                                                                | **Reason / Tradeoff**                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planner (heavy reasoning, JSON generation)** | **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google)                                                             | Excellent structured output, large free tier (15–60 req/min, 1M tokens free in Vertex AI). Stable.         |
| **AI Tool (inside executor)**                  | **Mistral (small/medium)** via [Mistral API](https://mistral.ai) OR **Groq Llama 3 8B** | Mistral has generous free tier & low price after; Groq offers *ultra-low latency* (ideal for dev loops).   |
| **Reviewer (fast, cheap judgment)**            | **Gemini 2.5 Flash** or **Claude 3 Haiku**                                              | Flash is super cheap + fast, good for yes/no/approve-type tasks. Haiku is another fallback for robustness. |
| **Fallback / Cross-check (optional)**          | **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**                                                                  | Use only when planner output fails validation. Good to have second opinion to reduce LLM hallucination.    |
| **Local Dev / Offline Mode**                   | **Ollama** (run Llama 3 / Phi-3 locally)                                                | No API cost, ideal for developers testing plans & executor pipelines offline.                              |

### Cost & Quota Estimate (2025)

| Provider           | Free Tier                                  | Paid Price (approx)                    | Notes                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro     | 60 RPM free (1M tokens/month in Vertex AI) | ~$0.0015 / 1k input tokens           | Very generous. Perfect for Planner. |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash   | 60 RPM free (same quota as Pro)            | ~$0.0005 / 1k input tokens           | Cheap & fast.                       |
| Mistral API        | 5M tokens/month free (small model)         | ~$0.20 / 1M tokens                   | Great for heavy iterative loops.    |
| GroqCloud          | Free tier 10M tokens/month                 | Paid: ~$0.12 / 1M tokens (Llama3-8B) | Extremely fast (20-30ms responses). |
| OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | 50 free requests/day for many dev accounts | $0.15 / 1M tokens                     | Best as fallback only.              |

### Practical Implementation Advice

#### 1. LLM Abstraction Layer
Keep your LLM abstraction layer (as in your architecture) so you can hot-swap providers without touching workflow logic.

#### 2. Model Router Implementation
Implement a model router that chooses provider based on:
- **Step type**: Planner → Gemini, AI tool → Mistral/Groq
- **Current usage/quota left**: Fallback to OpenAI or local model if exceeded
- **Response time requirements**: Use Groq for real-time interactions
- **Cost constraints**: Route to cheapest available model for the task

#### 3. Simple Telemetry
Add simple telemetry (tokens, latency, cost) → store in Temporal workflow history for future optimization:

```python
class LLMMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_tokens = 0
        self.total_cost = 0.0
        self.provider_usage = {}
    
    def record_call(self, provider: str, tokens: int, cost: float, latency: float):
        self.total_tokens += tokens
        self.total_cost += cost
        self.provider_usage[provider] = self.provider_usage.get(provider, 0) + 1
```

#### 4. Intelligent Caching
Cache plans when running iterative dev tasks — avoid re-generating if same input:

```python
import hashlib
import redis

def get_cached_plan(task_description: str) -> Optional[str]:
    cache_key = hashlib.md5(task_description.encode()).hexdigest()
    return redis_client.get(f"plan:{cache_key}")

def cache_plan(task_description: str, plan: str, ttl: int = 3600):
    cache_key = hashlib.md5(task_description.encode()).hexdigest()
    redis_client.setex(f"plan:{cache_key}", ttl, plan)
```

#### 5. Dynamic Fallback Logic
```python
async def call_ai_model(model: str, prompt: str, fallback=True):
    """
    Unified LLM call with fallback support
    model: "planner" | "reviewer" | "ai_tool"
    """
    try:
        if model == "planner":
            response = await call_gemini_pro(prompt)
            return response.text

        elif model == "reviewer":
            response = await call_gemini_flash(prompt)
            return response.text

        elif model == "ai_tool":
            # Try Mistral first for cost efficiency
            try:
                resp = await call_mistral(prompt)
                return resp.content
            except Exception:
                if fallback:
                    # Fallback to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
                    resp = await call_openai_mini(prompt)
                    return resp.content
                else:
                    raise
    except Exception as e:
        if fallback and model != "ai_tool":
            # Final fallback to OpenAI for planner/reviewer
            resp = await call_openai_mini(prompt)
            return resp.content
        raise
```

#### 6. Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Batch processing**: Group similar operations to reduce API overhead
- **Context compression**: Use smaller context windows when possible
- **Model warming**: Keep connections alive to reduce latency
- **Smart retries**: Don't retry expensive calls immediately; use cheaper models first

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compozy**             | • Multi-agent orchestration with workflows defined declaratively (YAML). <br>• Uses Temporal under the hood for durable, reliable execution. <br>• Focus on scalability, observability. | Probably less mature in domain-specific components like plan validation, tool broker security, idempotency, detailed feedback loops. May not provide all layers (QA, plan validator, DLQ) out of the box.                                                 |
| **Worka-Orchestrator**  | • Multi-agent workflows with DAGs, idempotency, built-in PII redaction, human-in-loop controls. <br>• Focuses on structured agent tasks and dependencies. | Might not have all enterprise observability (e.g. cost telemetry), tool registry + sandbox runtime features, vector DB plan learning built in. Probably less plug-and-play for deep tool governance.                                                      |
| **LangManus**           | • Multi-agent workflow, specialized agents for different responsibility roles. <br>• Visual workflow UI and backend + agents. | Probably lighter on deep policy enforcement, tool security, sandboxing, DLQ, cost control, observability. Might not have all the tiered LLM model routing components built in.                                                                            |
| **AutoGen (Microsoft)** | • Support for multi-agent systems, human-in-the-loop, tools. <br>• Good for defining conversational flows, agents talking with each other. | Less built-in infrastructure for enterprise monitoring, circuit breakers, tool broker with human approvals, plan validation, detailed failure analytics. More of a framework for the agent interactions than full orchestration + production reliability. |
| **ModelScope-Agent**    | • Framework for connecting open-source LLMs + tool integrations. <br>• Tool registration, memory control, evaluation. | Likely weaker around scaling, observability, multi-tenancy, sandboxed execution, advanced plan validation + review loops, DLQ handling.                                                                                                                   |
| **Nexus**               | • Lightweight multi-agent framework with supervisor hierarchy. <br>• Flexible workflows, open-source. | Possibly lean on governance, security tooling, strict validation, detailed cost/tracing, etc. Also may not have full sandboxing or tool broker approvals.                                                                                                 |

### Which Frameworks Are Best Base Projects

| Project                      | Why It's a Good Base                                                                                                                                                                 | What You'll Need to Extend                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compozy**                  | Because it's built on Temporal, supports declarative workflow definitions, and already assumes enterprise reliability. It's probably closest in infrastructure to your architecture. | Add in detailed plan validator, tool brokering & sandboxing, vector DB based plan learning & feedback loops, cost control, DLQ handling etc. |
| **Worka-Orchestrator**       | Very promising for workflows, DAGs, dependencies, idempotency, basic security. Good scaffold.                                                                                        | Extend to include richer observability, feedback & review service, stricter tool security policies, advanced tool runtime sandboxing.        |
| **LangManus** or **AutoGen** | Good for agent collaboration logic, defining roles, workflows, UI. Might help for prototyping or the plan/review loop.                                                               | Less ready for production infrastructure. Need to plug in state storage, monitoring, retries, DLQ, etc.                                      |
